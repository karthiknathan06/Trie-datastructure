# Tries 101

Ever wondered how Google instantly suggests relevant words or phrases as you type in the search bar? This magic is made possible by an efficient data structure called a Trie.

Google stores an immense database of past search queries and common phrases

As you type, Google quickly traverses the Trie to match the letters youâ€™ve entered with the stored queries. For each character you type, the system moves through the Trie nodes to find all possible continuations

Once potential matches are found, Google uses additional algorithms to rank these suggestions based on relevance, popularity, and your personal search history.

The entire process happens in real-time, within milliseconds. The efficiency of the Trie structure ensures that even with billions of stored queries, Google can quickly narrow down the list of suggestions.

## What is Trie Datastructure?

A Trie is a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings, where each node represents a character of a string.

The primary purpose of a Trie is to allow for efficient retrieval of a string with a given prefix, making it particularly useful in applications that require quick searches or autocomplete functionality.

## How Trie is Constructed?

A Trie consists of nodes, where each node represents a single character from the alphabet. Here's a breakdown of its components:

Root Node: The root node of a Trie is an empty node that doesn't contain any character.

Children Nodes: Each node in the Trie can have multiple children, each corresponding to a character in the alphabet. The child nodes are linked to their parent nodes through edges.

End of Word: A boolean flag is typically associated with each node to indicate whether it marks the end of a valid word in the Trie.

## When to use Trie?

Autocomplete Systems: Ideal for suggesting words or phrases as a user types.

Spell Checking: Efficient for validating words and suggesting corrections.

Longest Prefix Matching: Useful in networking for matching the longest prefix of IP addresses or URLs.

IP Routing: Enhances quick lookup and efficient memory usage in routing decisions.

Dictionary and Lexicon Storage: Effective for storing and retrieving words in applications like NLP or games.

Search Engine Indexing: Improves keyword-based searches by indexing documents based on prefixes.

Data Compression: Reduces memory usage by storing common prefixes only once.

Auto-correction and Predictive Text: Essential for mobile keyboards and text input systems to suggest or correct words.

Genome Analysis: Suitable for storing and searching DNA sequences that share common prefixes.

Efficient Data Retrieval with Prefix Constraints: Perfect for operations requiring frequent searches for items that start with a given prefix.

## When not to use Trie?

Small Datasets: If your dataset is small or doesn't require frequent prefix-based operations, simpler data structures like hash maps or arrays might be more efficient in terms of space.

Memory Constraints: Tries can consume a lot of memory, especially with a large alphabet or many strings. If memory usage is a concern, consider using a more memory-efficient structure like a Ternary Search Tree or a compressed Trie.
